# Algorithms and Data Structures Repository

Welcome to my **Algorithms and Data Structures** repository! ðŸ“šðŸ’»

## Purpose
This repo is a collection of notes and code examples related to algorithms and data structures. Itâ€™s designed to help me keep track of what Iâ€™ve learned and serve as a quick reference whenever I need it.

The examples here cover implementations in different programming languages Iâ€™ve learned along the way.

## What's Inside
- **Algorithms** - Sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and more.
- **Data Structures** - Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.
- **Code Examples** - Implementations in multiple programming languages.
- **Notes** - Explanations and breakdowns of concepts and techniques.

## Why This Repo?
I wanted a central place to organize and access everything Iâ€™ve studied about algorithms and data structures. Itâ€™s meant to grow over time as I explore more topics and languages.
